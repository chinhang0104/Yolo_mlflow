# YOLO Image Classification with MLflow

This project is a simple demo for training a YOLO image classification model with local MLflow logging.

## Notebook

You can explore the notebook `Yolo_mlflow.ipynb` directly. The first part includes a guide on training and logging with MLflow, while the second part provides command line code for running in bash.

## Environment

Use `conda.yaml` to create a new environment for the notebook.
